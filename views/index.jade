    h4 So what is this all about?
    p Most people agree that meetings tend to be underproductive. Many individuals fail to prepare properly for a meeting and usually there's always some douche asking stupid questions.
    p The main point is that 
      strong meetings take more time than is needed
      , and an extra half hour wasted in a meeting of ten is actually five hours lost. And meetings are the worst kind of interruptions because they make people lose momentum at work.
    p Unfortunately meetings are a necessary evil, 
      strong Meetoring is here to help you minimize that evil by monitoring your meetings.

    h4 How does this work?
    p Its simple! You start by introducing your cost per hour and joining the meeting and the meeter shows how much money you are spending since the start of the meeting.
    p You can and should invite other meeting attendees by sharing the URL with them so they can also join with their cost per hour.
    p Meetoring shows a real-time updated meeter for the total cost of the meeting taking into account the time each attendee joins and leaves.
